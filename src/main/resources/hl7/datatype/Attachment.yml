# to link to a file in the resulting json.

# See the spec at  http://hl7.org/fhir/datatypes-definitions.html#Attachment.size which says: The number of bytes is
# redundant if the data is provided as a base64binary, but is useful if the data is provided as a url reference.

# The hl7v2-fhir-converter will not set the hash field, since it isn't relevant without the url field.
# See the spec at http://hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#Attachment which says: The hash is included so that applications
